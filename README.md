# Healthcare Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of diabetes in patients using healthcare data, leveraging machine learning techniques such as KMeans clustering and Random Forest classification. The dataset includes critical factors like age, BMI, glucose levels, and insulin sensitivity to predict diabetes outcomes. The analysis also visualizes key relationships and identifies important features influencing diabetes risk.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for clustering (KMeans) and classification (Random Forest).
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**: Interactive environment for coding and analysis.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project includes patient data with features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin, and other medical attributes.
- The goal is to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on these features.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations of key relationships between features like BMI, age, glucose levels, and insulin.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Used to identify patient subgroups with similar risk profiles.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Trained to predict diabetes outcomes and identify important features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score used to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualizations**: Scatter plots, pie charts, confusion matrix, and feature importance graphs.

## Results
- KMeans clustering identified high-risk and low-risk patient groups based on features like age and BMI.
- The Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of **X%** (replace with your result) and highlighted **BMI** and **age** as the most important predictors of diabetes risk.
- Visualizations helped in understanding the relationships between the variables and interpreting the modelâ€™s predictions.
